# Slightly Wider JS editor

## Make FormStack JavaScript Editor a little wider
(Chrome only)
- NOT WORKING T_T -

Height didn't work, didn't want to bother too much with it.

Width is still limited by the parent's padding.



### Installation
- Go to: chrome://extensions/
- Activate developper mode
